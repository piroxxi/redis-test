So well. What I've looked at :

Jedis
https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis
  So this is Jedis, a simple way to execute Redis traditional
  commands in directly in Java. Basicaly you can do SET and GET
  quite easily. But still no ORM.

  Note: this one is available this way :
  "redis.clients" % "jedis" % "2.1.0" (see project/Build.scala)
